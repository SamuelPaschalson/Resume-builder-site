Overview
This license applies to all templates purchased that are made by me.

The Single-Use License gives you, the purchaser, the ability to use the template on an ongoing, non-exclusive basis.
You're allowed to use the template to create one single End Product for yourself or for one client (a “single application”), and the End Product can be distributed for free.
The “End Product” is the final customized version/implementation of the template that you will use or sell to a client.
In other words ...
You can use a Paid Template for only one person/business/project. If you want to use the purchased template for a different client or project, then you'll have to buy another license (by buying the template again). You can customize the template to any degree (adding, altering, or removing text, images, graphics, layout, design, etc.) to fit your project's needs.
What you can do with it
You can create one End Product for a client, and after you’re done, you can transfer it over to the client for any fee.
You can modify this template and manipulate it. The resulting works are subject to this license. This means no matter how much you modified a site that was based on this template, the resulting work is still subject to this license.
You can download the template and host it on a different server without attributing back to Me.
In other words ...
You can do anything to a template and use it for one project or sell it to one person/business. You can also purchase a new license if you want to use a newly purchased or customized template for another person/business/project.
What you can't do with it
You can’t sell the End Product to more than one client. Your client can't resell the End Product.
You can't incorporate the template in a work created for redistribution or resale by you or your client. You can’t re-distribute for free or resell the template as-is or after modifications.
You can’t extract a single component out of a template and use it outside the scope of the End Product.
The client or end user of the End Product can't extract a single component out of a template and use it outside the scope of the End Product.
In other words ...
The template as a whole and the things inside of it cannot be resold or given out for free. If you buy a template, modify its contents and then sell it to a person/business, that person/business can't sell it or give it away.
Miscellaneous info
The creator of the template retains ownership of the template but grants you the license on the the terms above. This license is between the template creator (me) and you. Themesforest is not a party to this license or the one giving you the license.
If a breach in this license is discovered, the creator of the template may take legal action. Themesforest may also take administrative action.

Transferring and duplicating templates
When you transfer a paid template to another person on Themesforest or elsewhere, you transfer your license to that person.
You are not allowed to "duplicate" a paid template and use it for another website. Each use of a paid template requires purchase of a Single Use License.

Templates are not "themes"
The design and layout of a chosen or purchased template will not automatically replace the design and layout of a pre-existing website in your account. Templates come as-is and may require customization.

By purchasing or choosing a template you agree to these terms and to Webflow's Terms of Use.
